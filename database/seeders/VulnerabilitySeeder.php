Failures typically lead to unauthorized information disclosure, modification, or destruction of all data or performing a business function outside the user\'s limits. Common access control vulnerabilities include: Violation of the principle of least privilege or deny by default, where access should only be granted for particular capabilities, roles, or users, but is available to anyone. Bypassing access control checks by modifying the URL (parameter tampering or force browsing), internal application state, or the HTML page, or by using an attack tool modifying API requests. Permitting viewing or editing someone else\'s account, by providing its unique identifier (insecure direct object references) Accessing API with missing access controls for POST, PUT and DELETE. Elevation of privilege. Acting as a user without being logged in or acting as an admin when logged in as a user. Metadata manipulation, such as replaying or tampering with a JSON Web Token (JWT) access control token, or a cookie or hidden field manipulated to elevate privileges or abusing JWT invalidation. CORS misconfiguration allows API access from unauthorized/untrusted origins. Force browsing to authenticated pages as an unauthenticated user or to privileged pages as a standard user.',

For all such data:Is any data transmitted in clear text? This concerns protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, FTP also using TLS upgrades like STARTTLS. External internet traffic is hazardous. Verify all internal traffic, e.g., between load balancers, web servers, or back-end systems.Are any old or weak cryptographic algorithms or protocols used either by default or in older code?Are default crypto keys in use, weak crypto keys generated or re-used, or is proper key management or rotation missing? Are crypto keys checked into source code repositories?Is encryption not enforced, e.g., are any HTTP headers (browser) security directives or headers missing?Is the received server certificate and the trust chain properly validated?Are initialization vectors ignored, reused, or not generated sufficiently secure for the cryptographic mode of operation? Is an insecure mode of operation such as ECB in use? Is encryption used when authenticated encryption is more appropriate? Are passwords being used as cryptographic keys in absence of a password base key derivation function?Is randomness used for cryptographic purposes that was not designed to meet cryptographic requirements? Even if the correct function is chosen, does it need to be seeded by the developer, and if not, has the developer over-written the strong seeding functionality built into it with a seed that lacks sufficient entropy/unpredictability? Are deprecated hash functions such as MD5 or SHA1 in use, or are non-cryptographic hash functions used when cryptographic hash functions are needed?Are deprecated cryptographic padding methods such as PKCS number 1 v1.5 in use? Are cryptographic error messages or side channel information exploitable, for example in the form of padding oracle attacks?',

Dynamic queries or non-parameterized calls without context-aware escaping are used directly in the interpreter. Hostile data is used within object-relational mapping (ORM) search parameters to extract additional, sensitive records. Hostile data is directly used or concatenated. The SQL or command contains the structure and malicious data in dynamic queries, commands, or stored procedures. Some of the more common injections are SQL, NoSQL, OS command, Object Relational Mapping (ORM), LDAP, and Expression Language (EL) or Object Graph Navigation Library (OGNL) injection. The concept is identical among all interpreters. Source code review is the best method of detecting if applications are vulnerable to injections. Automated testing of all parameters, headers, URL, cookies, JSON, SOAP, and XML data inputs is strongly encouraged. Organizations can include static (SAST), dynamic (DAST), and interactive (IAST) application security testing tools into the CI/CD pipeline to identify introduced injection flaws before production deployment.',

There is a difference between insecure design and insecure implementation. We differentiate between design flaws and implementation defects for a reason, they have different root causes and remediation. A secure design can still have implementation defects leading to vulnerabilities that may be exploited. An insecure design cannot be fixed by a perfect implementation as by definition, needed security controls were never created to defend against specific attacks. One of the factors that contribute to insecure design is the lack of business risk profiling inherent in the software or system being developed, and thus the failure to determine what level of security design is required.',
